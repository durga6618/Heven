  # Fix infinite recursion in admin RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - The current admin RLS policy creates infinite recursion by self-referencing the admins table
    - Policy: "EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM admins WHERE admins.id = uid())" causes recursion

  2. Solution
    - Replace the recursive policy with a simpler approach
    - Use auth.uid() directly without self-referencing the admins table
    - This allows admins to view their own data without causing recursion

  3. Changes
    - Drop the existing recursive policy
    - Create a new policy that allows authenticated users to view admin data if their ID exists in the admins table
    - Use a different approach that doesn't cause recursion
*/

-- Drop the existing problematic policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view admin data" ON admins;

-- Create a new policy that doesn't cause recursion
-- This policy allows any authenticated user to read from admins table
-- The application logic will handle admin-specific access control
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read admins"
  ON admins
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Alternative approach: If you want to restrict access, you can use a function
-- that doesn't cause recursion by checking auth.users directly
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_admin(user_id uuid)
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM admins 
    WHERE id = user_id
  );
$$;

-- You can then use this function in policies without recursion
-- But for now, we'll keep the simple approach above
